# Fractional-Calculator
This is a Java program that will perform basic operations - addition, subtraction, multiplication & division on mixed numbers, fractions or whole numbers and will produce a fractional result.

# Description
This calculator can take multiple numbers (>=2) and perform valid operations on them.

Some examples - 

a) Expression of 2 mixed numbers : 3_1/3 + 4_1/4 produces result as 7_7/12

b) Expression of more than 2 mixed numbers : 3_1/3 + 4_1/4 * 2 / produces result as 6_1/6

c) Expression of more than 2 mixed numbers, one of them being -ive : 3_1/3 + 4_1/4 * 2 / -3 produces result as 1/2

In case the expression has multiplication/division, it takes precendence over addition or subtraction.

Also, as can be seen from the example above, the calculator is designed to handle -ive numbers as well.

The supported operands for this calculator are + , - , * , /
